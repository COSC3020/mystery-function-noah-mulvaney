# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```

This function returns the maximum value in an array.

It compares the the first value of the array to the maximum of the rest of the list,
and then returns the greater of the two at each level of recursion, including at the top layer. The function checks the length as a base case. -Noah Mulvaney
